<h1> Interests in I.T.</h1>

<p>My interest in IT started at a very early age, with my soul interest being focused on video games. At an early age I had access to a Gameboy pocket, Nintendo 64, classic Xbox, ps2 and a PC. Experiencing classic, well known, video game franchises such as Mario and Zelda only fuelled my desire for video games and IT.</p>
<p>In my adolescence, my focus shifted to more PC orientated games as I discovered MMOs like Runescape and World of Warcraft. After discovering that it was possible to host Runescape private servers, I was suddenly introduced to the back-end of video games: programming. I started to explore the vast and confusing landscape of the Java programming language while sifting through the files of a Runescape private-server. Tinkering with this code, I tried to educate myself and see what I could change to affect the game. I was very inexperienced and did not get very far, but the process of problem solving and the concept of coding became very exciting to me.</p>
<p>In high-school, I had a teacher who saw my interest in programming. He graciously offered to provide me with some fundamental teachings in the Python and HTML programming languages. This extra course work was very exciting and helped to further my interest beyond just video games. I started to also find interest in computer hardware, web development and databases among many other aspects of the IT field.</p>
<p>My tertiary studies at Swinburne helped to introduce me to even more IT possibilities that didnâ€™t occur to me. I furthered my programming skills in other languages, including Pascal, C, C++, C#, Javascript, Mysql and PHP, and I was introduced to the wonders of visual design, learning how to use Photoshop and even 3D modelling software (Autodesk 3ds Max).</p>
<p>When choosing to return to study, I chose RMIT over returning to Swinburne as the units offered seemed to have content that better resonated with me. Reading each unit outline and the content made me excited to study, more so than similar degrees offered by other institutions. The RMIT course was also offered via correspondence which was exciting and suited me.</p>
<p>At the end of this degree I hope to have a firm knowledge in networking, security and programming. I lack knowledge in the networking and security fields and know that I can always further my knowledge of programming as there is so much to learn. It is my desire that at the conclusion of this course that I will be proficient in a skill set to either continue further studies or to work in the field of network/cyber security or software development.</p>
