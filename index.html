<p><b>About me:</b> My name is Johnathon, and I am a 26-year-old student who grew up in Shepparton Victoria. I move to Melbourne in 2012 and completed a Diploma in Game Development, after which, I started a bachelor of Information Technology, but deferred after a year to work in the retail industry. I worked at a JB Hi-Fi full time after deferring my degree. I had already been with the company for many years, as I worked at the Shepparton store while in high school, and later on, transferred to the Chadstone store as I moved to Melbourne. I worked at JB for a total of 10 years before deciding to finish an IT degree. I have decided to return to study and finish a bachelor's degree, as my interest in IT has remained strong. Apart from IT my other interest is music; Iâ€™ve played guitar for more than a decade and have a general interest in writing and composing music.</p>
