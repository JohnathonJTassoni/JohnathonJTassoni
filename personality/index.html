<h1>Personality</h1>

<h2>Test 1: MTB (16 Personality Types)</h2> 
<img src="/assets/16MTB.PNG" align="middle" width=500 >
<p>My personality type is ENFB (Campaigner). According to the results, people of type EFNP show characteristics of being joyful, playful, energetic and more. They tend to be perceptive of people’s feelings, be creative, spontaneous and outgoing, but they do lack organisation skills.</p>
<p>I find these results very accurate. I am definitely someone who is empathetic to people around me and am very outgoing and sociable and often try to be agreeable, as I try to avoid confrontation. I can lack a little self-discipline, which is also a trait present in this personality type.</p>

<h2> Test2: Online Learning Style</h2>

<p>My results show that I am a visual and tactile learner. I learn best when I am able to see a demonstration and I am able to recall information visually. Visual learners write down keywords and colour code things to help them revise and are rarely distracted when studying.</p>
<p>Tactile learners learn best by being hands-on and by doing activities relating to what they have just learnt. They are often energetic and are partial to fidgeting while studying.</p>
<p>Ive scored an equal 35% for both of these types of learning style and I can relate to both of them very closely. When working on course work or studying I often refer to visual examples like demonstrations or videos to see how it is done. I also find it highly valuable to do examples of my own to remember and properly learn the content provided. I often also listen to music or podcasts while doing task as I don’t find them a distraction and I prefer to work with background noise.</p>


<h2>Test 3: Big Five</h2> 
<img src="/assets/Big5A.PNG" align="middle" width=500 >
<p>According to the results I have scored very highly in Openness and Agreeableness. The traits of someone who ranks high in Openness details the person as creative, intellectual and playful. They are usually interested in art, culture and abstract concepts and seek unusual forms of self-expression.</p>
<p>The traits of someone high in Agreeableness are that of cooperative and empathetic. It is a trait where someone focuses on putting someone else’s happiness first, and they find it enjoyable to help others.</p> 
<p>This score of this test is very accurate as well. I do find myself putting others first, I enjoy helping people and I have a strong desire for exploring abstract ideas. I am also very interested in art, especially in terms of my musical hobby, and do enjoy exploring music through very complex and unconventional genres.</p>

<h2> Test Results Conclusion & Discussion</h2>
<p>The results from these tests are very in-sync with each other. They all describe me as an extroverted, empathetic and joyful person, who has an interest in creativity and abstract concepts. They further describe me as agreeable and energetic, even though I do lack self-discipline. I think when speaking in terms of a “team-member”, I would be a very valuable asset based on my personality. I would get a lot of value making sure that I am helping others and bring bright and fun energy with me.</p> 
<p>When speaking about weaknesses, my tendency to help others might mean that I would fall behind in my own tasks. Also, my tendency to be agreeable may sometimes be a hindrance, as I would avoid conflict with a team member, which is sometimes necessary.</p>
<p>I think when selecting a team it would be a good idea to have people who are equally energetic and outgoing as I am, but it would be wise to select a team where some members do feel comfortable with confrontation and are able help me keep on schedule as, in accordance with the test results, I do lack self-discipline.</p>
