<h1> Music App </h1>

<h2>Overview:</h2> 
<p>This app will be aimed at making using music notation much more accessible for mobile devices. The app will be aimed at players and teachers primarily and have a heavy focus on writing, notating and developing easy to use “documents” containing musically information. The app should provide an easy-to-use interface to plan lessons, demonstrate musical notation being played and provided quick and friendly editing features. </p>

<h2>Motivation:</h2> 
<p>As it currently stands there are many different apps that have lots of different features when it comes to handling musical notation. Some apps like the Ultimate-Guitar app provide musical notation play-back from a database, and some are similar to OnSong which lets you drag and drop chords over a page of lyrics.</p> 
<p>So while many of these apps do provided a very nice service for musicians, there doesnt appear to be an app that is robust and useful for a musical instruments teacher, to easily combine these functions in a single document, purely from their mobile device. As someone who has had private tutor and who has also proceeded to teach, there is a lack of software that combines all these elements together. As it currently stands, most teachers seem to cobble together many different pieces of software (or hard-copy pages) to provide lesson material.</p> 
<p>This app will incorporate, improve and expand upon these apps with the teaching music lessons in mind. The app is designed to help teach construct lessons by creating, cropping, and editing musical notation and chord charts into a lesson document with ease. These documents can then be presented in a formal lesson via mobile device and even sent to the student.</p> 

<h2>Description:</h2> 
<p>The app will have many features already present in other apps currently on the market, those will be covered first. It will be able to access a database of playable notation and perform the playback function so that the user can play along or view the song being played. It will have multiple instrument panels (as songs have multiple instruments) volume and EQ controls, and playback options (such as half-speed, double speed).  The notation playback will also let users create their own sheet music. They can choose an instrument, and will have access to a wide array of editing tools to create their own notation/sheet music, much like GuitarPro software available for PC.</p> 
<p>Like OneSong, this app will also let users create and view chord charts. User can access a chord chart database, but can also create their own. They will be able to copy in a page of lyrics and add their own chords/chord charts above the desired lyrics to the tempo of the song. This will be a drag and drop feature over the lyrics on the page.</p> 
<p>The new unique features of this app, will utilise these previous features. It will allow for a user to create a document, where they are able to insert cropped out sections of playable notation and chord charts, as well as letting the user add written notation and notes. Teachers will be able to essentially create a “lesson document” where they can insert lesson-specific music notation (riffs/song sections, etc) and chords that they wish the student to learn, focus on, and study. The teacher is then able to add simple notes to each part, for use of describing why/how to play the notated passage or chords entered. The copied piece of playable notation will function within the document.</p>
<p>The teacher can then create many lesson plan documents and change smaller parts to cater to individual students and play styles. They are then able to use simply a mobile device to access these lesson documents, or they are able to deploy/send the lesson plan to the student. The latter method could be extremely helpful if a lesson is cancelled or if they are teaching long-distance, as the teacher can still provide a student with a lesson even if they are unable to be face to face.</p> 

<h2>Tools & Tech:</h2> 
<p>There are a quite a few options to consider when deciding what tools to use to build the app. For this particular app it would be desirable to have it function on multiple operating systems, and be as robust as possible. The hardware limitations aren’t particularly troublesome in our case, as this app is essentially combining multiple functionality from similar apps that are currently available, to have them in one easy to use, neat package.</p>
<p>The app will basically function like a word processor, but with the added functionality of the playable music notation, which should be able to be imbedded and played from a document. While it would be cheap to use a service like BuildFire, the app will most likely need to be built from the ground up due to the nature of the music notation function. The complexity of being able to have playback and editing functionality for sheet music and notated tab is unique and will require the most amount of work.</p>

<h2>Skills required:</h2> 
<p>To build the app the most important skills required are programming skills. We will need develops who are proficient with languages like Java, C, C++ and Kotlin to handle the front end of development and we also require knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP to handle the web and database functionality. As the app should allow users to access a database of user-created notation that is hosted on a website like Ultimate-Guitar.com.</p>
<p>It should be very easy and relatively straight-forward to find developers who are able to create the app, as previously mentioned, this app is simply taking features that do currently exist in other apps but are combining them in a robust way, to create a sort of system where a user could drag-and-drop different elements in to a text document.</p>

<h2>Outcome:</h2> 
<p>If the app doest prove to be successful, it should become a major tool used in conducting music lessons. The hope is that the app will make the planning of music lessons much easier and also accessible, as teachers can deploy there lesson plays, much like university lecturer constructs an entire units worth of work before the first week of a course. Hopefully this app will be successful and gain support from existing websites that host user created musical content, after which they can choose to share this content with the app, so that teachers can use this content as part of their teaching. This could also be a great way for music sites to expose themselves to a wider audience.</p>
