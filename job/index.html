<h1> Ideal I.T Job </h1>

<h2>Job Pathway A: Cyber security</h2>
<img src="/assets/Cyber1.PNG" >
<p>A cyber security engineer is a job that requires someone to work in a team which help to protect computer systems against hackers and intruders. Their role is to develop systems, update systems, and analyse system flaws. I find it and exciting role as it will require vast problem-solving knowledge to defend against a dynamically changing threat.</p>

<h2>Job Pathway B: Software Development</h2>
<img src="/assets/Develp3.PNG" >
<p>A software developer/engineer will require someone with a knowledge of multiple programming languages, to develop and update systems and applications that are used in many different industries, from gaming to finance. Again, this job is exciting to me because I will be able to either create new application/systems or implement new technologies into existing ones. It will require, again, a large amount of problem solving, and it would be exciting to be part of a team that develops technology for many different industries.</p>

<h2> Discussion </h2>
<p>These jobs both have similar requirements for their applicants. 
In terms of skills gathered through this this degree, all of them require experience in multiple programming languages, working with multiple operating systems and working on IT projects as part of a team (including as part of a team, bug fixing, iteration, etc). They require a degree in computer science (or an equivalent degree), and some require a post graduate degree as well. </p>
<p>These jobs also require more general skills like communication and time management.
Some have a requirement where the applicant has previously worked on a project in the IT industry, and while this may not be possible straight after graduating, it is something to aspire and work towards as a goal.</p>  

<p>A few of these skills I already possess. Through working in retail for many years, I have plenty of experience communicating, working in many different, successful team, meeting corporate goals and expectations (KPI), time management and even, leading a team.</p>
<p>While I have gained much knowledge across many programming languages, I feel it is still quite basic or at an intermediate level at best. I have also have a very fundamental and basic understand of networking an security. These skills are definitely the skills that need to improved and are what I am currently focused on improving. It is my hope that through doing this course, I will gain much more knowledge in these areas and I will be prepared to either further my studies or join be prepared to seek a job. I know that even at the end of this course, there will still be much to learn, and that working in the IT industry is the best place to further the knowledge provided by this course.</p>
